gretel until moon rises then we shall see crumbs bread which i have strewn about they will show us our way home again when moon came they set out but they found no crumbs many thousands birds which fly about woods fields had picked them all up hansel said gretel we shall soon find way but they did not find it they walked whole night all next day too from morning till evening but they did not get out forest were very hungry they had nothing eat but two three berries which grew ground they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath tree fell asleep it was now three mornings since they had left their father house they began walk again but they always came deeper into forest if help did not come soon they must die hunger weariness when it was midday they saw beautiful snowwhite bird sitting bough which sang so delightfully that they stood still listened it when its song was over it spread its wings flew away before them they followed it until they reached little house roof which it alighted when they approached little house they saw that it was built bread covered cakes but that windows were clear sugar we will set work that said hansel have good meal i will eat bit roof you gretel can eat some window it will taste sweet hansel reached up above broke off little roof try how it tasted gretel leant against window nibbled at panes then soft voice cried from parlour nibble nibble gnaw who nibbling at my little house children answered wind wind heavenborn wind went eating without disturbing themselves hansel who liked taste roof tore down great piece it gretel pushed out whole one round windowpane sat down enjoyed herself it suddenly door opened woman old hills who supported herself crutches came creeping out hansel gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had their hands old woman however nodded her head said oh you dear children who has brought you here do come stay me no harm shall happen you she took them both hand led them into her little house then good food was set before them milk pancakes sugar apples nuts afterwards two pretty little beds were covered clean white linen hansel gretel lay down them

power she killed it cooked ate it that was feast day her witches have red eyes cannot see far but they have keen scent like beasts are aware when human beings draw near when hansel gretel came into her neighbourhood she laughed malice said mockingly i have them they shall not escape me again early morning before children were awake she was already up when she saw both them sleeping looking so pretty their plump rosy cheeks she muttered herself that will be dainty mouthful then she seized hansel her shrivelled hand carried him into little stable locked him behind grated door scream he might it would not help him then she went gretel shook her till she awoke cried get up lazy thing fetch some water cook something good your brother he stable outside be made fat when he fat i will eat him gretel began weep bitterly but it was all vain she was forced do what wicked witch commanded now best food was cooked poor hansel but gretel got nothing but crabshells every morning woman crept little stable cried hansel stretch out your finger that i may feel if you will soon be fat hansel however stretched out little bone her old woman who had dim eyes could not see it thought it was hansel finger was astonished that there was no way fattening him when four weeks had gone hansel still remained thin she was seized impatience would not wait any longer now then gretel she cried girl stir yourself bring some water let hansel be fat lean tomorrow i will kill him cook him ah how poor little sister did lament when she had fetch water how her tears did flow down her cheeks dear god do help

how i am do it how do i get silly goose said old woman door big enough just look i can get myself she crept up thrust her head into oven then gretel gave her push that drove her far into it shut iron door fastened bolt oh then she began howl quite horribly but gretel ran away godless witch was miserably burnt death gretel however ran like lightning hansel opened his little stable cried hansel we are saved old witch dead then hansel sprang like bird from its cage when door opened how they did rejoice embrace each other dance about kiss each other they had no longer any need fear her they went into witch house every corner there stood chests full pearls jewels these are far better than pebbles said hansel thrust into his pockets whatever could be got gretel said i too will take something
