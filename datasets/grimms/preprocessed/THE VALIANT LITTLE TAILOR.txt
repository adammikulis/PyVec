thought he had finished off grasshopper good earliest dawn giants went into forest had quite forgotten little tailor when all at once he walked up them quite merrily boldly giants were terrified they were afraid that he would strike them all dead ran away great hurry little tailor went onwards always following his own pointed nose after he had walked long time he came courtyard royal palace he felt weary he lay down grass fell asleep whilst he lay there people came inspected him all sides read his girdle seven at one stroke ah said they what does great warrior want here midst peace he must be mighty lord they went announced him king gave it their opinion that if war should break out this would be weighty useful man who ought no account be allowed depart counsel pleased king he sent one his courtiers little tailor offer him military service when he awoke ambassador remained standing sleeper waited until he stretched his limbs opened his eyes then conveyed him this proposal this very reason have i come here tailor replied i am ready enter king service he was therefore honourably received special dwelling was assigned him soldiers however were set against little tailor wished him thousand miles away what be end this they said among themselves if we quarrel him he strikes about him seven us will fall at every blow not one us can stand against him they came therefore decision

hundred horsemen followed him when he came outskirts forest he said his followers just stay waiting here i alone will soon finish off giants then he bounded into forest looked about right left after while he perceived both giants they lay sleeping under tree snored so that branches waved up down little tailor not idle gathered two pocketsful stones these climbed up tree when he was halfway up he slipped down branch until he sat just above sleepers then let one stone after another fall breast one giants long time giant felt nothing but at last he awoke pushed his comrade said why are you knocking me you must be dreaming said other i am not knocking you they laid themselves down sleep again then tailor threw stone down second what meaning this cried other why are you pelting me i am not pelting you answered first growling they disputed about it time but they were weary they let matter rest their eyes closed once more little tailor began his game again picked out biggest stone threw it all his might breast first giant that too bad cried he sprang up like madman pushed his companion against tree until it shook other paid him back same coin they got into such rage that they tore up trees belaboured each other so long that at last they both fell down dead ground at same time then little tailor leapt down it lucky thing said he that they did not tear up tree which i was sitting i should have had sprint another like squirrel but we tailors are nimble he drew out his sword gave each them couple thrusts breast then went out horsemen said work done i have finished both them off but it was hard work they tore up trees their sore need defended themselves them but all that no purpose when man like myself comes who can kill seven at one blow but are you not wounded asked horsemen you need not concern yourself about that answered tailor they have not bent one hair mine horsemen would not believe him rode into forest there they found giants swimming their blood all round about lay tornup trees little tailor demanded king promised reward he however repented his promise again bethought himself how he could get rid hero before you receive my daughter half my

huntsmen thither that they might see prisoner their own eyes hero however went king who was now whether he liked it not obliged keep his promise gave his daughter half his kingdom had he known that it
