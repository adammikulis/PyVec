he could soothe her she at last seemed be appeased but she was not so truth was only thinking how she should punish him one day he took her walk him out town showed her spot where boat was set adrift upon wide waters then he sat himself down said i am very much tired sit me i will rest my head your lap sleep while soon he had fallen asleep however she drew ring from his finger crept softly away wished herself her son at home their kingdom when he awoke he found himself alone saw that ring was gone from his finger i can never go back my father house said he they would say i am sorcerer i will journey forth into world till i come again my kingdom so saying he set out travelled till he came hill where three giants were sharing their father goods they saw him pass they cried out said little men have sharp wits he shall part goods between us now there was sword that cut off enemy head whenever wearer gave words heads off cloak that made owner invisible gave him any form he pleased pair boots that carried wearer wherever he wished heinel said they must first let him try these wonderful things then he might know how set value upon them then they gave him cloak he wished himself fly

asked boots also moment he had all three his power he wished himself at golden mountain there he was at once so giants were left behind no goods share quarrel about heinel came near his castle he heard sound merry music people around told him that his queen was about marry another husband then he threw his cloak around him passed through castle hall placed himself side queen where no one saw him but when anything eat was put upon her plate he took it away ate it himself when glass wine was handed her he took it drank it thus though they kept giving her meat drink her plate cup were always empty upon this fear remorse came over her she went into her chamber alone sat there weeping he followed her there alas said she herself was i not once set free why then does this enchantment still seem bind me false fickle one said he one indeed came who set thee free he now near thee again but how have you used him ought he have had such treatment from thee then he went out sent away company
