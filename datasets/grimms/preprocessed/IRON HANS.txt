there was once upon time king who had great forest near his palace full all kinds wild animals one day he sent out huntsman shoot him roe but he did not come back perhaps some accident has befallen him said king next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were search him but they too stayed away then third day he sent all his huntsmen said scour whole forest through do not give up until you have found all three but these also none came home again none were seen again from that time forth no one would any longer venture into forest it lay there deep stillness solitude nothing was seen it but sometimes eagle hawk flying over it this lasted many years when unknown huntsman announced himself king seeking situation offered go into dangerous forest king however would not give his consent said it not safe there i fear it would fare you no better than others you would never come out again huntsman replied lord i will venture it at my own risk fear i know nothing huntsman therefore betook himself his dog forest it was not long before dog fell some game way wanted pursue it but hardly had dog run two steps when it stood before deep pool could go no farther naked arm stretched itself out water seized it drew it under when huntsman saw that he went back fetched three men come buckets bale out water when they could see bottom there lay wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron whose hair hung over his face down his knees they bound him cords led him away castle there was great astonishment over wild man king however had him put iron cage his courtyard forbade door be opened pain death queen herself was take key into her keeping from this time forth everyone could again go into forest safety king had son eight years who was once playing courtyard while he was playing his golden ball fell into cage boy ran thither said give me my ball out not till you have opened door me answered man no said boy i will not do that king has forbidden it ran away next day he again went asked his ball wild man said open my door but boy would not third day king had ridden out hunting boy went once more said i cannot open door even if i wished i have not key then wild man said it lies under your mother pillow you can get it there boy who wanted have his ball back cast all thought winds brought key door opened difficulty boy pinched his fingers when it was open wild man stepped out

into forest when king came home he observed empty cage asked queen how that had happened she knew nothing about it sought key but it was gone she called boy but no one answered king sent out people seek him fields but they did not find him then he could easily guess what had happened much grief reigned royal court when wild man had once more reached dark forest he took boy down from his shoulder said him you will never see your father mother again but i will keep you me you have set me free i have compassion you if you do all i bid you you shall fare well treasure gold have i enough more than

polluted i will come every evening see if you have obeyed my order boy placed himself brink well often saw golden fish golden snake show itself therein took care that nothing fell he was thus sitting his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it water he drew it quickly out again but saw that it was quite gilded whatsoever pains he took wash gold off again all was no purpose evening iron hans came back looked at boy said what has happened well nothing nothing he answered held his finger behind his back that man might not see it but he said you have dipped your finger into
