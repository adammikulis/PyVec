there was once poor widow who lived lonely cottage front cottage was garden wherein stood two rosetrees one which bore white other red roses she had two children who were like two rosetrees one was called snowwhite other rosered they were good happy busy cheerful ever two children world were only snowwhite was more quiet gentle than rosered rosered liked better run about meadows fields seeking flowers catching butterflies but snowwhite sat at home her mother helped her her housework read her when there was nothing do two children were so fond one another that they always held each other hand when they went out together when snowwhite said we will not leave each other rosered answered never so long we live their mother would add what one has she must share other they often ran about forest alone gathered red berries no beasts did them any harm but came close them trustfully little hare would eat cabbageleaf out their hands roe grazed their side stag leapt merrily them birds sat still upon boughs sang whatever they knew no mishap overtook them if they had stayed too late forest night came they laid themselves down near one another upon moss slept until morning came their mother knew this did not worry their account once when they had spent night wood dawn had roused them they saw beautiful child shining white dress sitting near their bed he got up looked quite kindly at them but said nothing went into forest when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close precipice would certainly have fallen into it darkness if they had gone only few paces further their mother told them that it must have been angel who watches over good children snowwhite rosered kept their mother little cottage so neat that it was pleasure look inside it summer rosered took care house every morning laid wreath flowers her mother bed before she awoke which was rose from each tree winter snowwhite lit fire hung kettle hob kettle was brass shone like gold so brightly was it polished evening when snowflakes fell mother said go snowwhite bolt door then they sat round hearth mother took her spectacles read aloud out large book two girls listened they sat spun close them lay lamb upon floor behind them upon perch sat white dove its head hidden beneath its wings one evening they were thus sitting comfortably together someone knocked at door if he wished be let mother said quick rosered open door it must be traveller who seeking shelter rosered went pushed back bolt thinking that it was poor man but it was not it was bear that stretched his broad black head within door rosered screamed sprang back lamb bleated dove fluttered snowwhite hid herself behind her mother bed but bear began speak said do not be afraid i will do you no harm i am
