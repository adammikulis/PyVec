there was once man called frederick he had wife whose name was catherine they had not long been married one day frederick said kate i am going work fields when i come back i shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked good draught ale very well said she it shall all be ready when dinnertime drew nigh catherine took nice steak which was all meat she had put it fire fry steak soon began look brown crackle pan catherine stood fork turned it then she said herself steak almost ready i may well go cellar ale so she left pan fire took large jug went into cellar tapped ale cask beer ran into jug catherine stood looking at last it popped into her head dog not shut uphe may be running away steak that well thought so up she ran from cellar sure enough rascally cur had got steak his mouth was making off it away ran catherine away ran dog across field but he ran faster than she stuck close steak it all gone “what cant be cured must be endured” said catherine so she turned round she had run good way was tired she walked home leisurely cool herself now all this time ale was running too catherine had not turned cock when jug was full liquor ran upon floor till cask was empty when she got cellar stairs she saw what had happened my stars said she what shall i do keep frederick from seeing all this slopping about so she thought while at last remembered that there was sack fine meal bought at last fair that if she sprinkled this over floor it would suck up ale nicely what lucky thing said she that we kept that meal we have now good use it so away she went it but she managed set it down just upon great jug full beer upset it thus all ale that had been saved was set swimming floor also ah well said she when one goes another may well follow then she strewed meal all about cellar was quite pleased her cleverness said how very neat clean it looks at noon frederick came home now wife cried he what have you dinner o frederick answered she i was cooking you steak but while i went down draw ale dog ran away it while i ran after him ale ran out when i went dry up ale sack meal that we got at fair i upset jug but cellar now quite dry looks so clean kate kate said he how could you do all this why did you leave steak fry ale run then spoil all meal why frederick said she i did not know i was doing wrong you should have told me before husband thought himself if my wife manages matters thus i must look sharp myself now he had good deal gold house so he said catherine what pretty yellow buttons these are i shall put them into box bury them garden but take care that you never go near meddle them no frederick said she that i never will soon he was gone there came some pedlars earthenware plates dishes they asked her whether she would buy oh dear me i should

stood musing while at last said her husband hark ye frederick we will soon get gold back let us run after thieves well we will try answered he but take some butter cheese you that we may have something eat way very well said she they set out frederick walked fastest he left his wife some way behind it does not matter thought she when we turn back i shall be so much nearer home than he presently she came top hill down side which there was road so narrow that cart wheels always chafed trees each side they passed ah see now said she how they have bruised wounded those poor trees they will never get well so she took pity them made use butter grease them all so that wheels might not hurt them so much while she was doing this kind office one her cheeses fell out basket rolled down hill catherine looked but could not see where it had gone so she said well i suppose other will go same way find you he has younger legs than i have then she rolled other cheese after it away it went nobody knows where down hill but she said she supposed that they knew road would follow her she could not stay there all day waiting them at last she overtook frederick who desired her give him something eat then she gave him dry bread where are butter cheese said he oh answered she i used butter grease those poor trees that wheels chafed so one cheeses ran away so i sent other after it find it i suppose they are both road together somewhere what goose you are do such silly things said husband how can you say so said she i am sure you never told me not they ate dry bread together

did he told her thought herself way frederick wants something eat but i dont think he very fond butter cheese ill bring him bag fine nuts vinegar i have often seen him take some when she reached home she bolted back door but front door she took off hinges said frederick told me lock door but surely it can nowhere be so safe if i take it me so she took her time way when she overtook her husband she cried out there frederick there door itself you may watch it carefully you please alas alas said he what clever wife i have i sent you make house fast you take door away so that everybody may go out

scarcely were they up than who should come but very rogues they were looking they were truth great rascals belonged that class people who find things before they are lost they were tired so they sat down made fire under very tree where frederick catherine were frederick slipped down other side picked up some stones then he climbed up again tried hit thieves head them but they only said it must be near morning wind shakes firapples down catherine who had door her shoulder began be very tired but she thought it was nuts upon it that were so heavy so she said softly frederick i must let nuts go
