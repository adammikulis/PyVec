it was middle winter when broad flakes snow were falling around that queen country many thousand miles off sat working at her window frame window was made fine black ebony she sat looking out upon snow she pricked her finger three drops blood fell upon it then she gazed thoughtfully upon red drops that sprinkled white snow said would that my little daughter may be white that snow red that blood black this ebony windowframe so little girl really did grow up her skin was white snow her cheeks rosy blood her hair black ebony she was called snowdrop but this queen died king soon married another wife who became queen was very beautiful but so vain that she could not bear think that anyone could be handsomer than she was she had fairy lookingglass which she used go then she would gaze upon herself it say tell me glass tell me true all ladies land who fairest tell me who glass had always answered thou queen art fairest all land but snowdrop grew more more beautiful when she was seven years old she was bright day fairer than queen herself then glass one day answered queen when she went look it usual thou queen art fair beauteous see but snowdrop lovelier far than thee when she heard this she turned pale rage envy called one her servants said take snowdrop away into wide wood that i may never see her any more then servant led her away but his heart melted when snowdrop begged him spare her life he said i will not hurt you thou pretty child so he left her herself though he thought it most likely that wild beasts would tear her pieces he felt if great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not kill her but leave her her fate chance someone finding saving her then poor snowdrop wandered along through wood great fear wild beasts roared about her but none did her any harm evening she came cottage among hills went rest her little feet would carry her no further everything was spruce neat cottage table was spread white cloth there were seven little plates seven little loaves seven little glasses wine them seven knives forks laid order wall stood seven little beds she was very hungry she picked little piece each loaf drank very little wine out each glass after that she thought she would lie down rest so she tried all little beds but one was too long another was too short till at last seventh suited her there she laid herself down went sleep came masters cottage now they were seven little dwarfs that lived among mountains dug searched gold they lighted up their seven lamps saw at once that all was not right first said who has been sitting my stool second who has been eating off my plate third who has been picking my bread fourth who has been meddling my spoon fifth who has been handling my fork sixth who has been cutting my knife seventh who has been drinking my wine then first looked round said who has been lying my bed rest came running him everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed but seventh saw snowdrop called all his brethren come see her they cried out wonder astonishment brought their lamps look at her said good heavens what lovely child she they were very glad see her took care not wake her seventh dwarf slept hour each other dwarfs turn till night was gone morning snowdrop told them all her story they pitied her said if she would keep all things order cook wash knit spin them she might stay where she was they would take good care her then they went out all day long their work seeking gold silver mountains but snowdrop was left at home they warned her said queen will soon find out where you are so take care let no one but queen now that she thought snowdrop was dead believed that she must be handsomest lady land she went her glass said tell me glass tell me true all ladies land who fairest tell me who glass answered thou queen art fairest all this land but over hills greenwood shade where seven dwarfs their dwelling have made there snowdrop hiding her head she lovelier far o queen than thee then queen was very much frightened she knew that glass always spoke truth was sure that servant had betrayed her she could not bear think that anyone lived who was more beautiful than she was so she dressed herself up old pedlar went her way over hills place where dwarfs dwelt then she knocked at door cried fine wares sell snowdrop looked out at window said good day good woman what have you sell good wares fine wares said she laces bobbins all colours i will let old lady she seems be very good sort body thought snowdrop she ran down unbolted door bless me said old woman how badly your stays are laced let me lace them up one my nice new laces snowdrop did not dream any mischief so she stood before old woman but she set work so nimbly pulled lace so tight that snowdrop breath was stopped she fell down if she were dead there end all thy beauty said spiteful queen went away home evening seven dwarfs came home i need not say how grieved they were see their faithful snowdrop stretched out upon ground if she was quite dead however they lifted her up when they found what ailed her they cut lace little time she began breathe very soon came life again then they said old woman was queen herself take care another time let no one when we are away when queen got home she went straight her glass spoke it before but her great grief it still said thou queen art fairest all this land but over hills greenwood shade where seven dwarfs their dwelling have made there snowdrop hiding her head she lovelier far o queen than thee then blood ran cold her heart spite malice see that snowdrop still lived she dressed herself up again but quite another dress from one she wore before took her poisoned comb when she reached dwarfs cottage she knocked at door cried fine wares sell but snowdrop said i dare not let anyone then queen said only look at my beautiful combs gave her poisoned one it looked so pretty that she took it up put it into her hair try it but moment it touched her head poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless there you may lie said queen went her way but good luck dwarfs came very early that evening when they saw snowdrop lying ground they thought what had happened soon found poisoned comb when they took it away she got well told them all that had passed they warned her once more not open door anyone meantime queen went home her glass shook rage when she read very same answer before she said snowdrop shall die if it cost me my life so she went herself into her chamber got ready poisoned apple outside looked very rosy tempting but whoever tasted it was sure die then she dressed herself up peasant wife travelled over hills dwarfs cottage knocked at door but snowdrop put her head out window said i dare not let anyone dwarfs have told me not do you please said old woman but at any rate take this pretty apple i will give it you no said snowdrop i dare not take it you silly girl answered other what are you afraid do you think it poisoned come do you eat one part i will eat other now apple was so made up that one side was good though other side was poisoned then snowdrop was much tempted taste apple looked so very nice when she saw old woman eat she could wait no longer but she had scarcely put piece into her mouth when she fell down dead upon ground this time nothing will save thee said queen she went home her glass at last it said thou queen art fairest all fair then her wicked heart was glad happy such heart could be when evening came dwarfs had gone home they found snowdrop lying ground no breath came from her lips they were afraid that she was quite dead they lifted her up combed her hair washed her face wine water but all was vain little girl seemed quite dead so they laid her down upon bier all seven watched bewailed her three whole days then they thought they would bury her but her cheeks were still rosy her face looked just it did while she was alive so they said we will never bury her cold ground they made coffin glass so that they might still look at her wrote upon it golden letters what her name was that she was king daughter coffin was set among hills
